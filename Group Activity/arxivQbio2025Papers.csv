"arXiv:2501.00013","Relation-Aware Equivariant Graph Networks for Epitope-Unknown Antibody Design and Specificity Optimization","Lirong Wu, Haitao Lin, Yufei Huang, Zhangyang Gao, Cheng Tan, Yunfan Liu, Tailin Wu, Stan Z. Li","Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that protect the host by binding to specific antigens, and their binding is mainly determined by the Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) in the antibody. Despite the great progress made in CDR design, existing computational methods still encounter several challenges: 1) poor capability of modeling complex CDRs with long sequences due to insufficient contextual information; 2) conditioned on pre-given antigenic epitopes and their static interaction with the target antibody; 3) neglect of specificity during antibody optimization leads to non-specific antibodies. In this paper, we take into account a variety of node features, edge features, and edge relations to include more contextual and geometric information. We propose a novel Relation-Aware Antibody Design (RAAD) framework, which dynamically models antigen-antibody interactions for co-designing the sequences and structures of antigen-specific CDRs. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation metric to better measure antibody specificity and develop a contrasting specificity-enhancing constraint to optimize the specificity of antibodies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior capability of RAAD in terms of antibody modeling, generation, and optimization across different CDR types, sequence lengths, pre-training strategies, and input contexts.",2024-12-14,2024-12-14,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00013"

Rempala","We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.",2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00187"
"arXiv:2501.00194","Minimal Models for RNA Simulations","D. Thirumalai, Naoto Hori, Hung T. Nguyen","The increasing importance of RNA as a prime player in biology can hardly be overstated. Problems in RNA, such as folding and RNA-RNA interactions that drive phase separation, require cations. Because experiments alone cannot reveal the dynamics of cation-RNA interactions, well calibrated theory and computations are needed to predict how ions control the behavior of RNA. The perspective describes the development and use of coarse-grained models at different resolutions. We focus on single- and three-interaction site interaction models, in which electrostatic interactions are treated using a combination of explicit and implicit representations. Applications to the folding of ribozymes and riboswitches are discussed, with emphasis on the role of monovalent and divalent cations. We also discuss phase separation in low complexity sequences. Challenges in the simulation of complex problems such as ribosome assembly and RNA chaperones, requiring developments of models for RNA-protein interactions, are pointed out.",2025-06-08,2024-12-31,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00194"
"arXiv:2501.00278","A data-driven biophysical network model reproduces C. elegans premotor neural dynamics","Megan Morrison, Lai-Sang Young","C. elegans locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of C. elegans neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biophysical dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. The model correctly predicts behavior such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received, and we demonstrate that it can be used to study how the activity level of certain individual neurons impacts behavior.",2024-12-31,2024-12-31,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00278"

To promote further collaboration between biological and artificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2025 edition of the Algonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies (this https URL). In collaboration with the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod), this edition aims to bring forth a new generation of brain encoding models that are multimodal and that generalize well beyond their training distribution, by training them on the largest dataset of fMRI responses to movie watching available to date. Open to all, the 2025 challenge provides transparent, directly comparable results through a public leaderboard that is updated automatically after each submission to facilitate rapid model assessment and guide development.

"arXiv:2501.00720","Overground gait transitions are not sharp but involve gradually changing walk-run mixtures even over long distances","Nicholas S. Baker, Leroy Long, Manoj Srinivasan","Humans typically walk at low speeds and run at higher speeds. Previous studies of transitions between walking and running were mostly on treadmills, but real-world locomotion allows more flexibility. Here, we study overground locomotion over long distances (800 m or 2400 m) under time constraints, simulating everyday scenarios like going to an appointment. Unlike on treadmills, participants can vary both speed and gait during this task. We find that gait transition in this overground task occurs over a broad `gait transition regime' spanning average speeds from 1.9 m/s to 3.0 m/s. In this regime, people use mixtures of walking and running: mostly walking at low average speeds (around 1.9 m/s) and mostly running at high average speeds (3.0 m/s); the walk vs run fraction gradually changes between these speed limits. Within any walk-run mixture, there is a speed gap between the walking and running. These gait mixtures and their specific structure are predicted by energy optimality. These findings extend earlier results from much shorter distance tasks, showing that similar energetic principles govern longer, more physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Overall, our results highlight the role of whole-task energy minimization including transients in shaping human locomotion.",2025-09-12,2025-01-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00720"
"arXiv:2501.00723","Metabolic energy expenditure for time-varying isometric forces","Sriram Sekaripuram Muralidhar, Kristen Heitman, Samuel C. Walcott, Manoj Srinivasan","Muscles consume metabolic energy (ATP) to produce force. A mathematical model for energy expenditure can be useful in estimating real-time costs of movements or to predict energy optimal movements. Metabolic cost models developed so far have predominantly aimed at dynamic movement tasks, where mechanical work dominates. Further, while it is known that both force magnitude and rate of change of force (force rate) affect metabolic cost, it is not known how these terms interact, or if the force rate dependence can be a consequence of the force dependence. Here, we performed extensive human subject experiments, involving each subject over 5 hours of metabolic trials, which systematically changed the mean forces and forces rates so as to characterize a holistic relation for metabolic cost based on both force and force rate -- or analogously, torque and torque rate. Our experiments involved humans producing symmetric or asymmetric sinusoidal forces with different means, amplitudes, frequencies, and rise and fall periods. We showed that the metabolic cost can be well-approximated by a sum of power law functions of torque and torque rate. We found that the metabolic cost scales non-linearly with joint torque (with exponent = 1.36) and non-linearly with torque rate (with exponent = 2.5). Surprisingly, the data suggested that the cost was roughly four times higher for decreasing the torque than increasing, mirroring the analogous ratio between the cost of positive and negative work. Using these metabolic cost relations, we show that if the metabolic cost scales with particular exponents with muscle force and force rates, the same exponents will be observed in multi-joint tasks with multiple muscles. Our new metabolic cost model involving both force and force rate will potentially allow better predictions of energy optimal movements and thus inform wearable robot design and analysis.",2025-01-01,2025-01-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00723"
"arXiv:2501.00730","Evolution of mutating pathogens in networked populations","Aviel Ivry, Reuven Cohen, Amikam Patron","Epidemic spreading over populations networks has been an important subject of research for several decades, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most epidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their spreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a pathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We consider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and study the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use analytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the conditions for it to spread. We also use numerical simulations to study the pathogen flow in this case, and to understand the mutation phenomena. We show that the natural selection leads to less violent pathogens becoming predominant in the population. We discuss a wide range of network structures and show how different effects are manifested in each case. We also applied our theory in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, using relevant epidemiological data collected for this outbreak. We provided explanations for the variants spreading processes observed throughout this pandemic.",2025-09-27,2025-01-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00730"
"arXiv:2501.00767","Infectious diseases, imposing density-dependent mortality on MHC/HLA variation, can account for balancing selection and MHC/HLA polymorphism","D. P. L. Green","The human MHC transplantation loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, -DRB1) are the most polymorphic in the human genome. It is generally accepted this polymorphism reflects a role in presenting pathogen-derived peptide to the adaptive immune system. Proposed mechanisms for the polymorphism such as negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and heterozygote advantage (HA) focus on HLA alleles, not haplotypes. Here, we propose a model for the polymorphism in which infectious diseases impose independent density-dependent regulation on HLA haplotypes. More specifically, a complex pathogen environment drives extensive host polymorphism through a guild of HLA haplotypes that are specialised and show incomplete peptide recognition. Separation of haplotype guilds is maintained by limiting similarity. The outcome is a wide and stable range of haplotype densities at steady-state in which effective Fisher fitnesses are zero. Densities, and therefore frequencies, emerge theoretically as alternative measures of fitness. A catalogue of ranked frequencies is therefore one of ranked fitnesses. The model is supported by data from a range of sources including a Caucasian HLA dataset compiled by the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). These provide evidence of positive selection on the top 350-2000 5-locus HLA haplotypes taken from an overall NMDP sample set of 10E5. High-fitness haplotypes drive the selection of 137 high-frequency alleles spread across the 5 HLA loci under consideration. These alleles demonstrate positive epistasis and pleiotropy in the formation of haplotypes. Allelic pleiotropy creates a network of highly inter-related HLA haplotypes that account for 97% of the census sample. We suggest this network has properties of a quasi-species and is itself under selection. We also suggest this is the origin of balancing selection in the HLA system.",2025-01-01,2025-01-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00767"
"arXiv:2501.00869","Towards an integrative approach to the study of brain-environment interactions in human and non-human primate","David Thura","By retracing my scientific journey that began 20 years ago, I highlight in this thesis the need to consider the organization of the brain, which is certainly globally hierarchical, but also highly distributed and mixed in the neuronal response of its different areas (by focusing on the sensorimotor cortex-basal ganglia network). I also emphasize the importance of adopting behavioral paradigms that reflect as much as possible the characteristics of the scenarios encountered in the real life of animals. And finally, I mention the importance of ""disintegrating"" the way data analysis is traditionally carried out, and of taking into account the dynamic nature of behavior, for example by favoring the study of behavioral variables and so-called ""latent"" neuronal activities. I conclude this thesis by presenting the vision of my ideal laboratory in a perspective of 5 to 10 years from today. This laboratory would have two experimental devices, a first, classic, for carrying out tests in a constrained and therefore unnatural environment, the data of which would be compared to those from a second device called ""naturalistic"" in which the animals could potentially express their entire behavioral repertoire. The tasks tested would be characterized by strong ecological principles, such as in those simulating the properties of foraging, and the data would make it possible to test hypotheses based on the progressive addition of ecological components in these tasks, all this in order to maintain control over the interpretability of these data which are complex by nature.",2025-01-01,2025-01-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.00869"

We aimed to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and metabolic syndrome and its risk factors in this population group. We used cross-sectional data from the 2012-2013 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Metabolic syndrome is defined as having 3 or more risk factors: elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, or elevated fasting blood glucose. We used binomial logistic regression to test associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and metabolic syndrome, and multiple linear regression to test associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and each risk factor. We included the following covariates: age, sex, smoking status, education level, socio-economic status, remoteness of location, season, and body mass index (BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that each 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration was statistically significantly associated with a 16% lower risk of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.92) and a 2.1 cm (95% confidence interval: 1.65, 2.57) lower waist circumference (BMI was not included in the model for waist circumference).

Research links patients' perceptions of care quality to improved outcomes such as safety, clinical efficacy, treatment adherence, and preventive practices. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and care perception in these patients and explore potential associations between these dimensions. Material and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 43 patients attending an advanced CKD clinic. Quality of life was assessed using the KDQOL-36 questionnaire, while the IECPAX questionnaire measured perceived care quality. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from patient records. Participants completed the questionnaires during routine visits, with scores analysed to identify associations between variables. Results: The study included 60% men (n=28) and 32% women (n=15), with a mean age of 78 years . Among participants, 45% were diabetic, 79% hypertensive, and 58% took more than five medications daily. Mean scores were 78.76 for KDQOL-36 and 5.54 for IECPAX. Significant differences were found in the physical role domain between men and women (p=0.01) and for individuals over 65 years (p=0.04). Higher IECPAX scores were associated with taking more than five medications (p=0.05). However, no correlation was observed between KDQOL-36 and IECPAX scores. Conclusions: The findings suggest that quality of life and perceived care quality are independent in advanced CKD patients. While this study provides insights, larger multicentre studies are needed to validate these results.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable.

Despite rapidly growing databases documenting structural and functional information for various protein sequences, our understanding of proteins remains limited because of the large possible sequence space and the complex inter- and intra-molecular forces. Deep learning, which is characterized by its ability to learn relevant features directly from large datasets, has demonstrated remarkable performance in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. It has also been increasingly applied in recent years to the data-rich domain of protein sequences with great success, most notably with Alphafold2's breakout performance in the protein structure prediction. The performance improvements achieved by deep learning unlocks new possibilities in the field of protein bioinformatics, including protein design, one of the most difficult but useful tasks. In this paper, we broadly categorize problems in protein bioinformatics into three main categories: 1) structural prediction, 2) functional prediction, and 3) protein design, and review the progress achieved from using deep learning methodologies in each of them.

"arXiv:2501.01687","Innate behavioural mechanisms and defensive traits in ecological models of predator-prey types","Sangeeta Saha, Swadesh Pal, Roderick Melnik","There are various examples of phenotypic plasticity in ecosystems that serve as the basis for a wide range of inducible defences against predation. These strategies include camouflage, burrowing, mimicry, evasive actions, and even counterattacks that enhance survival under fluctuating predatory threats. Additionally, the ability to exhibit plastic responses often influences ecological balances, shaping predator-prey coexistence over time. This study introduces a predator-prey model where prey species show inducible defences, providing new insights into the role of adaptive strategies in these complex interactions. The stabilizing impact of the defensive mechanism is one of several intriguing outcomes produced by the dynamics. Moreover, the predator population rises when the interference rate increases to a moderate value even in the presence of lower prey defence but decreases monotonically for stronger defence levels. Furthermore, we identify a bistable domain when the handling rate is used as a control parameter, emphasizing the critical role of initial population sizes in determining system outcomes. By considering the species diffusion in a bounded region, the study is expanded into a spatio-temporal model. The numerical simulation reveals that the Turing domain decreases as the level of protection increases. The study is subsequently extended to incorporate taxis, known as the directed movement of species toward or away from another species. Our investigation identifies the conditions under which pattern formation emerges, driven by the interplay of inducible defences, taxis as well as species diffusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that including taxis within the spatio-temporal model exerts a stabilizing influence, thereby diminishing the potential for pattern formation in the system.",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.01687"

Robust methods are needed for estimating population abundance to guide effective management. Traditional methods such as capture-recapture are often impractical for invasive species due to ethical, legal and logistical constraints. Here, I showcase the application of hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models for estimating the abundance of invasive rodents using removal data. First, I perform a simulation study which demonstrates minimal bias, as well as good precision and reliable coverage of confidence intervals across a range of sampling scenarios. I also illustrate the consequences of violating the population closure assumption, showing how between-occasion dynamics can bias inference. Second, I analyze removal data for two invasive rodent species, namely coypus (Myocastor coypus) in France and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in the Netherlands. Using hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models, I examine the effects of temperature on abundance while accounting for imperfect and time-varying capture probabilities. I also show how to accommodate spatial variability using random effects, quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates, and account for violations of closure by fitting an open-population model to multi-year data.

"arXiv:2501.01939","Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments","Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Kenneth Distefano, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.01939"

Synaptic learning has demonstrated its effectiveness in changing the probability of selecting actions based on their outcome. In the extreme case, it is vital not to repeat an action to a given goal that led to harmful punishment. The present model proposes a simple neural mechanism of gain modulation that makes possible immediate changes in the probability of selecting a goal after punishment of variable intensity. Results show how gain modulation determine the type of elementary navigation process within the state space of a network of neuronal populations of excitatory neurons regulated by inhibition. Immediately after punishment, the system can avoid the punished populations by going back or by jumping to unpunished populations. This does not require particular credit assignment at the `choice' population but only gain modulation of neurons active at the time of punishment. Gain modulation does not require statistical relearning that may lead to further errors, but can encode memories of past experiences without modification of synaptic efficacies. Therefore, gain modulation can complements synaptic plasticity.",2024-12-18,2024-12-18,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.01964"

Results: The mental component of SF-36 was jointly predicted by the overall severity scores (t(74) = -3.61, P < 0.001) and overall general fluctuations (t(74) = -2.98, P = 0.004). The physical SF-36 was found to be related only to the overall symptom severity scores (t(74) = -7.09, P < 0.001), but not to the overall fluctuations. The assessment of the impact of different components showed that the mental component of SF-36 was significantly influenced by the combined effect of average fatigue (t(73) = -3.86, P < 0.001), between-day cognitive symptoms fluctuations (t(73) = -3.22, P = 0.002), and within-day mood fluctuations (t(73) = -2.48, P = 0.015). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the impact of self-reported symptom fluctuations across multiple motor and non-motor domains on mental but not physical HRQoL in FMD and highlighted the importance of assessing and managing fluctuations in clinical practice.",2025-03-15,2024-12-18,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.01966"
"arXiv:2501.02028","Selecting ChIP-seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions","Sara Colando, Danae Schulz, Johanna Hardin","Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of interest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given that ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for determining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is between-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To illustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions for downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count data where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We then externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence peakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets obtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two experimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as differentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are less sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a more robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are satisfied.",2025-06-11,2025-01-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.02028"

The FP theorizes that the FPFP5 are mutually dependent through shared etiology and positive feedbacks, so that the total number of FPFP5 deficits (NFPFP5) should be highly predictive of existing deficits. Alternatively, the FI theorizes that strong mutual dependencies exist between \emph{all} age-related health deficits, so that the FI would be more predictive. We investigated predictive models of FPFP5 using FI or NFPFP5 in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We find that the FI, chronological age, and current deficit state are all important predictors of future FPFP5 deficits.

The rationale for this approach is the inherent scalability and speed enabled by using pre-calculated data embedded in existing PubChem identifiers (CID and SID), thereby eliminating the computationally intensive step of on-the-fly molecular descriptor generation. The approach was effectively demonstrated across four diverse bioassays: antagonists of the human D3 dopamine receptor, Rab9 promoter activators, small-molecule inhibitors of CHOP, and antagonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor. A comparison, based on Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), was conducted between the CID_SID ML model, the MORGAN2-based ML model, and the RDKit-transformed SMILES model for these four case studies, revealing that no method is universally superior in terms of performance. Furthermore, the CID_SID model averaged a rapid execution time of only 3.3 seconds; the ML models relying on explicit structural descriptors, such as MORGAN2 and RDKit-transformed SMILES, demonstrated high computational costs, with processing times averaging 106.0 and 109.6 seconds, respectively. While negligible for a single ML model, these times would cause a significant difference in computational resource consumption when scaled across a framework involving over a million buildings. Moreover, the CID_SID ML model achieved strong average performance metrics: Accuracy of 83.52%, Precision of 89.62%, Recall of 75.65%, F1-Score of 81.93% and ROC of 83.53%.",2025-12-03,2025-01-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.02154"

In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects.

In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions.

Based on the sub-riemannian framework introduced in 2023, we model the space of fragments as a set of short curves defined by kinematic parameters. We then introduce a geometric kernel that serves as a model for cortical connectivity and use it in a differential equation to describe cortical activity. By applying a grouping algorithm to this cortical activity model, we successfully recover the neural states observed in Kadmon-Harpaz et al, which were based on measured cortical activity.

In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit.

Shnerb","Competition between species and genotypes is a dominant factor in a variety of ecological and evolutionary processes. Biological dynamics are typically highly stochastic, and therefore, analyzing a competitive system requires accounting for the random nature of birth and death processes (demographic stochasticity) as well as the variability of external conditions (environmental stochasticity). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of species life history, showing that differences in life history lead competing species to experience different levels of demographic stochasticity. Here, we propose a simple model of two-species competition with different life histories and derive analytical expressions for various properties (fixation probability, fixation time, absorption time, probability density) under a wide range of conditions, including migration, selection, and environmental stochasticity. These properties provide insights into the long-term outcomes of competition, such as species persistence, extinction risks, and the influence of environmental variability on the evenness of the community.",2025-01-08,2025-01-07,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.03682"

By extending the uphill runs and shortening the downhill runs the cells migrate towards the higher attractant zones. Motivated by this, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm where an agent moves in one dimension in the presence of an attractant gradient. The agent can perform two actions: either persistent motion in the same direction or reversal of direction. We assign costs for these actions based on the recent history of the agent's trajectory. We ask the question: which RL strategy works best in different types of attractant environment. We quantify efficiency of the RL strategy by the ability of the agent (a) to localize in the favorable zones after large times, and (b) to learn about its complete environment. Depending on the attractant profile and the initial condition, we find an optimum balance is needed between exploration and exploitation to ensure the most efficient performance.",2025-01-07,2025-01-07,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2501.03687"

To address this, we propose a new method called affine feature response transform (AFRT), which exploits the brain's retinotopic organization. Applying AFRT to encode multi-unit activity in areas V1, V4, and IT of the macaque brain, we demonstrate that AFRT reduces redundant computations and enhances the performance of current linearizing encoding models by segmenting each neuron's receptive field into an affine retinal transform, followed by a localized feature response. Remarkably, by factorizing receptive fields into a sequential affine component with three interpretable parameters (for shifting and scaling) and response components with a small number of feature weights per response, AFRT achieves encoding with orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to unstructured models. We show that the retinal transform of each neuron's encoding agrees well with the brain's receptive field.

However, they are negatively impacted by climatic stressors such as drought or heat waves. In this paper, we introduce FORTE, an open-source system for environmental monitoring with the aim of understanding how forests react to such stressors. It consists of two key components: (1) a wireless sensor network (WSN) deployed in the forest for data collection, and (2) a Data Infrastructure for data processing, storage, and visualization. The WSN contains a Central Unit capable of transmitting data to the Data Infrastructure via LTE-M and several spatially independent Satellites that collect data over large areas and transmit them wirelessly to the Central Unit. Our prototype deployments show that our solution is cost-effective compared to commercial solutions, energy-efficient with sensor nodes lasting for several months on a single charge, and reliable in terms of data quality. FORTE's flexible architecture makes it suitable for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications beyond forest monitoring. The contributions of this paper are three-fold.

Insulin helps glucose in your blood enter your muscle, fat, and liver cells so they can use it for energy or store it for later use. If insulin is insufficient, it causes sugar to build up in the blood and leads to serious health problems. People with Type 1 Diabetes need synthetic insulin every day. In diabetes management, continuous glucose monitoring is an important feature that provides near real-time blood glucose data. It is useful in deciding the synthetic insulin dose. In this research work, we used machine learning tools, deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and voting and stacking regressors to predict blood glucose levels at 30-min time intervals using the latest DiaTrend dataset. Predicting blood glucose levels is useful in better diabetes management systems. The trained models were compared using several evaluation metrics.

Through the analytical results and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the initial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and the predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the success/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global dynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional response function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II functional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find that whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the predator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture rates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied, then the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the same ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey species is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and hence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two prey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture rates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass of the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the invasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's effectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.",2025-02-01,2025-02-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.00410"

There are no evident repeated sequences in selected membrane binding RNAs. This implies small and varied motifs responsible for membrane affinity. Such subsequences have been partially defined. Bound RNAs require divalents like Mg2+ and/or Ca2+, preferring more ordered phospholipids: gel, ripple or rafted membranes, in that order. RNAs also bind and stabilize bilayers that are bent or sharply deformed. In contrast, RNA binding without divalents extends to negatively charged membranes formed from simpler anionic phospholipids, and to plausibly prebiotic fatty acid bilayers. RNA-membranes also retain RNA function, such as base pairing, passive transport of tryptophan, specific affinity for peptide side chains, like arginine, and catalysis by ribozymic ligase. Multiple membrane-bound RNAs with biochemical functions, linked by specific base-pairing are readily constructed. Given these experimental facts, genetic effects seem plausible. RNA functions often reside in few nucleotides, and are easily joined in a small RNA. Base-paired groups of these can evolve to be purposeful, joining related RNA functions. Such RNA groups permit complex genome functions, but require only replication of short RNAs. RNA-membranes facilitate accurate RNA segregation at cell division, and quickly evolve by appending new base-paired functions. Thus, ancient RNA-membranes could act as a protogenome, supporting orderly encoded RNA expression, inheritance and evolution before DNA and the DNA genome.",2025-01-17,2025-01-17,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.00647"

In this study, we employed an innovative extraction method to isolate peptides from cumin seeds for the first time and screened their biological activities, revealing significant antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic properties. Guided by bioactivity, we utilized advanced separation and structural identification techniques, including Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS), to systematically purify and characterize cumin-derived peptides. A total of 479 unique peptide sequences were identified using Mascot software and the SwissProt/UniProt_Bos databases.

There is a clear need of rigorous procedures for experimental tests for ANNs models of the visual brain, and more generally, to understand ANNs devoted to generic vision tasks.

Targeting surveillance to international travelers in major travel hubs may offer a more efficient strategy for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.Methods: We developed and calibrated a multiple-strain metapopulation model of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission using extensive epidemiological, phylogenetic, and high-resolution air travel data. We then compared baseline surveillance with various resource-allocation approaches that prioritize travelers, focusing on Omicron BA.1/BA.2 retrospectively and on hypothetical future variants under different emergence, transmission and vaccine effectiveness scenarios.Findings: Focusing existing surveillance resources on travelers at key global hubs significantly shortened detection delays without increasing total surveillance efforts. In retrospective analyses of Omicron BA.1/BA.2, traveler-targeted approaches consistently outperformed baseline strategies, even when overall resources were reduced. Simulations indicate that focusing surveillance on key travel hubs outperform baseline practices in detecting future variants, across different possible origins, even with reduced resources. This approach also remains effective in future pandemic scenarios with varying reproductive numbers and vaccine effectiveness.Interpretation: These findings provide a quantitative, cost-effective framework for strengthening global genomic surveillance.

We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt comprehension based on the frequency of speakers making stereotype-incongruent statements. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers make stereotype-congruent or incongruent statements, with incongruency base rate manipulated. In Experiment 1, stereotype-incongruent statements decreased high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillatory power in the low base rate condition but increased it in the high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with listeners' openness trait: less open-minded participants tended to show theta increases to stereotype incongruencies, while more open-minded participants tended to show theta decreases. In Experiment 2, we dissociated incongruency base rate from the target speaker by manipulating it using a non-target speaker and found that only the high-beta effect persisted. Our findings reveal two potential mechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism (indicated by high-beta oscillations) that adjusts overall expectations about hearing statements that violate social stereotypes, and a speaker-specific mechanism (indicated by theta oscillations) that updates a more detailed mental model specifically about an individual speaker.

To address these challenges, we present the design of a bespoke polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) derivative conjugated with both phenothiazine and methacrylate functionalities, enabling staining-free antibacterial photodynamic effects, cellular tolerability and processability into various wound dressing formats, including films, textile fibres and nanoscale coatings. Tosylation of PVA is leveraged for the covalent coupling of toluidine blue, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the minimal release of TB in vitro. UV-induced network formation is exploited to accomplish cast films and nanoscale integrated wound dressing coatings. UV curing is also successfully coupled with an in-house wet spinning process to realise individual, water-insoluble fibres as the building blocks of fibrous wound dressings.

This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.",2025-02-03,2025-02-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.01716"
"arXiv:2502.01939","Human fields and their impact on brain waves A pilot study","Jesus Acosta-Elias, Santiago Mendez-Moreno, Omar Vital-Ochoa, Ricardo Espinosa-Tanguma","During brain function, groups of neurons fire synchronously. When these groups are large enough, the resulting electrical signals can be measured on the scalp using Electroencephalography (EEG). The amplitude of these signals can be significant depending on the size and synchronization of the neural activity. EEG waves exhibit distinct patterns based on the brain's state, such as whether it is asleep, awake, engaged in mental calculations, or performing other cognitive functions. Additionally, these patterns can be modified by external factors, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS involves bringing an antenna that generates variable electromagnetic fields close to specific areas of the skull to treat certain pathologies. Given that the human body naturally generates magnetic fields, a question arises: Can these fields influence the EEG by modulating neuronal function, causing a resonance effect, or through some unknown interaction? This study investigated whether approaching the palm of the hand to the top of the head (Intervention) could induce effects in the EEG. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was obtained for the 30 seconds preceding the intervention (PSD_pre) and the final 30 seconds of the intervention (PSD_last). The exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggests that the median of PSD_pre is greater than the median of PSD_last at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.004353). In contrast, in the control group, the test indicates that at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.7667), the median of PSD_pre is not greater than the median of PSD_last.",2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.01939"

Signorelli","This article defines a partial order structure to study the relationship between levels and contents of conscious subjective experience in a single mathematical set-up. We understand phenomenal structure as extrapolated relationships among experiences, instead of fixed properties of specific experiences. Our mathematical account is based on multilayer network theory. Multilayer theory is a generalization of graph and network theory, widely used in several scientific domains. This structure is also the underlying conceptual and mathematical structure of most current models of conscious experience. From our simple set of assumptions, yet rigorous analysis, we conclude that assuming the comparison and quantification among phenomenal experiences yield only partial comparison, rather than commonly assumed absolute comparability. This has implications for evolutionary and animal consciousness: evolution may encompass diverse modes of experiencing, not necessarily implying larger ones on an absolute scale. Our characterization elucidates structural constraints on experiential comparisons imposed by assumptions and choices made by modellers as active participants in the scientific process. In summary, in light of our phenomenological intuitions, it might be right that some experiences carry qualitative aspects that make them incompatible or non-comparable with other experiences, quantitatively speaking. Some experiences are comparable (e.g. at some experiential levels), but others are not. These results have direct implications for consciousness science, evolution and animal consciousness.",2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.02154"

Kelly","Accurate identification of druggable pockets and their features is essential for structure-based drug design and effective downstream docking. Here, we present RAPID-Net, a deep learning-based algorithm designed for the accurate prediction of binding pockets and seamless integration with docking pipelines. On the PoseBusters benchmark, RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 54.9% of Top-1 poses with RMSD < 2 A and satisfying the PoseBusters chemical-validity criterion, compared to 49.1% for DiffBindFR. On the most challenging time split of PoseBusters aiming to assess generalization ability (structures submitted after September 30, 2021), RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 53.1% of Top-1 poses with RMSD < 2 A and PB-valid, versus 59.5% for AlphaFold 3. Notably, in 92.2% of cases, RAPID-Net-guided Vina samples at least one pose with RMSD < 2 A (regardless of its rank), indicating that pose ranking, rather than sampling, is the primary accuracy bottleneck. The lightweight inference, scalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable option for large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Across diverse benchmark datasets, RAPID-Net outperforms other pocket prediction tools, including PUResNet and Kalasanty, in both docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of RAPID-Net to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by highlighting its performance on pharmacologically relevant targets. RAPID-Net accurately identifies distal functional sites, offering new opportunities for allosteric inhibitor design. In the case of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, RAPID-Net uncovers a wider array of potential binding pockets than existing predictors, which typically annotate only the orthosteric pocket and overlook secondary cavities.",2025-07-23,2025-02-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.02371"

Current scRNA-seq approaches, however, lack spatial context and rely on incomplete datasets of ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), limiting accurate cell type annotation and cell-cell communication (CCC) inference. This study addresses these challenges using a novel graph neural network (GNN) model that enhances cell type prediction and cell interaction analysis. Our study utilized a dataset consisting of 49,020 cells from 19 patients across three cancer types: Leukemia, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Colorectal Cancer. The proposed scGSL model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average accuracy of 84.83%, precision of 86.23%, recall of 81.51%, and an F1 score of 80.92% across all datasets. These metrics represent a significant enhancement over existing methods, which typically exhibit lower performance metrics. Additionally, by reviewing existing literature on gene interactions within the TME, the scGSL model proves to robustly identify biologically meaningful gene interactions in an unsupervised manner, validated by significant expression differences in key gene pairs across various cancers.

However, integrating these complementary modalities remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce scBIT, a novel method for enhancing AD prediction by combining fMRI with single-nucleus RNA (snRNA). scBIT leverages snRNA as an auxiliary modality, significantly improving fMRI-based prediction models and providing comprehensive interpretability. It employs a sampling strategy to segment snRNA data into cell-type-specific gene networks and utilizes a self-explainable graph neural network to extract critical subgraphs. Additionally, we use demographic and genetic similarities to pair snRNA and fMRI data across individuals, enabling robust cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments validate scBIT's effectiveness in revealing intricate brain region-gene associations and enhancing diagnostic prediction accuracy. By advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to the single-cell level, scBIT sheds new light on biomarker discovery in AD research. Experimental results show that incorporating snRNA data into the scBIT model significantly boosts accuracy, improving binary classification by 3.39% and five-class classification by 26.59%.

The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions.

These techniques, especially in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), require advanced manual skills. While their repetitive and time-consuming nature makes them suitable candidates for automation, the automation process is complicated by the need for extensive contact with the tissue. Addressing this, we demonstrate a semi-autonomous contactless surgical procedure using our novel Robot-assisted Laser Tissue Soldering (RLTS) system on a live porcine bowel. Towards this in-vivo demonstration, we optimized soldering protocols and system parameters in ex-vivo experiments on porcine bowels and a porcine cadaver. To assess the RLTS system performance, we compared the pressure at which the anastomosis leaked between our robotic soldering and manual suturing. With the best setup, we advanced to an in-vivo Heineke Mikulicz closure on small bowel incision in live pigs and evaluated their healing for two weeks. All pigs successfully completing the procedure (N=5) survived without leaks and the histology indicated mucosal regeneration and fibrous tissue adhesion.

Although Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) has a lower number of cases compared to other forms of diabetes, it is often diagnosed at a young age and requires lifelong exogenous insulin administration. In this paper, we focus on understanding the interaction of insulin and glucose molecules within the subcutaneous layer, which is crucial for blood sugar control in T1DM patients. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive model to characterize the insulin-glucose system within the subcutaneous layer, incorporating a multicellular molecular communication system. We then divide the T1DM system into insulin and glucose subsystems and derive the end-to-end expression for insulin-glucose interaction in the subcutaneous layer. We further validate the insulin-glucose interaction analysis with an agent-based simulator. As effectively managing postprandial glucose levels is crucial for individuals with T1DM to safeguard their overall health and avert short-term and long-term complications, we also derive the optimal insulin administration time based on the derived glucose response via the Lagrange multiplier and gradient descent ascent method. This allows us to explore the impact of different types of insulin and dietary management on blood sugar levels.

The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR.

Here, we extend distance-based phylogenetics using an entropy-based likelihood of the evolution among pairs of taxa, allowing for fast Bayesian inference in genome-scale datasets. We provide evidence of a close link between the inference criteria used in distance methods and Felsenstein's likelihood, such that the methods are expected to have comparable performance in practice. Using the entropic likelihood, we perform Bayesian inference on three phylogenetic benchmark datasets and find that estimates closely correspond with previous inferences. We also apply this rapid inference approach to a 60-million-site alignment from 363 avian taxa, covering most avian families.

It is widely used in neuroscience research, but the literature lacks established protocols in modalities that do not support healthy control measurements, such as intracranial EEG (icEEG). An icEEG normative map would allow researchers to learn about population-level brain activity and enable comparison of individual data against these norms to identify abnormalities. Currently, no standardised guide exists for transforming clinical data into a normative, regional icEEG map. Papers often cite different software and numerous articles to summarise the lengthy method, making it laborious for other researchers to understand or apply the process. Our protocol seeks to remedy this gap by providing a dataflow guide and key decision points that summarise existing methods. This protocol is used heavily in published works from our own lab (twelve peer-reviewed journal publications). Briefly, we take as input, icEEG recordings and neuroimaging data from people with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for resective surgery. As final outputs, we obtain a normative icEEG map, comprising signal properties localised to brain regions. Optionally, we can also process new subjects through the same pipeline and obtain their z-scores (or centiles) in each brain region, for abnormality detection and localisation. To date, a single, cohesive, dataflow pipeline for generating normative icEEG maps, along with abnormality mapping, has not been created.

During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain. There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function, aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.04574"

However, despite the promise of human-AI integration, current AI models are largely trained on massive datasets, optimized for population-level performance, lacking mechanisms to align their computations with individual users' perceptual semantics and neural dynamics. Here we show that integrating human behavioral insights and millisecond scale neural data within a fine tuned CLIP based model not only captures generalized and individualized aspects of perception but also over doubles behavioral performance compared to the unmodified CLIP baseline. By embedding human inductive biases and mirroring dynamic neural processes during training, personalized neural fine tuning improves predictions of human similarity judgments and tracks the temporal evolution of individual neural responses.

The use of RRF has also enabled the development of computationally efficient and accurate methods for testing the autocorrelation of lineage rates in a phylogeny (CorrTest) and selecting data-driven parameters of the birth-death speciation model (ddBD), which can be used to specify priors in Bayesian molecular dating. We have developed R3F, an R package implementing RRF to estimate divergence times, infer lineage rates, conduct CorrTest, and build a ddBD tree prior for Bayesian dating in molecular phylogenies. Here, we describe R3F functionality and explain how to interpret and use its outputs in other visualization software and packages, such as MEGA, ggtree, and FigTree. Ultimately, R3F is intended to enable the dating of the Tree of Life with greater accuracy and precision, which would have important implications for studies of organism evolution, diversification dynamics, phylogeography, and biogeography.

Watson, Helen M. Byrne","Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall. The early stages of atherosclerosis are driven by interactions between lipids and monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDMs). The mechanisms that govern the spatial distribution of lipids and MDMs in the lesion remain poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a spatially-resolved and lipid-structured model for early atherosclerosis. The model development and analysis are guided by images of human coronary lesions by Nakashima et al. 2007. Consistent with their findings, the model predicts that lipid initially accumulates deep in the intima due to a spatially non-uniform LDL retention capacity. The model also qualitatively reproduces the global internal maxima in the Nakashima images only when the MDM mobility is sufficiently sensitive to lipid content, and MDM lifespan sufficiently insensitive. Introducing lipid content-dependence to MDM mobility and mean lifespan produced minimal impact on model behaviour at early times, but strongly impacted lesion composition at steady state. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM lifespan to lipid content yield lesions with fewer MDMs, less total lesion lipid content and reduced mean MDM infiltration depth. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM mobility to lipid content also reduces the MDM infiltration depth, but increases the proportion of lipid-laden MDMs. We find that MDM lipid content increases with spatial depth, regardless of blood LDL and HDL content. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive spatial variation in the composition of early atherosclerotic lesions, and the role of macrophage lipid content in disease progression.",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.05039"

Eden","Hippocampal ripple-replay events are typically identified using a two-step process that at each time point uses past and future data to determine whether an event is occurring. This prevents researchers from identifying these events in real time for closed-loop experiments. It also prevents the identification of periods of nonlocal representation that are not accompanied by large changes in the spectral content of the local field potentials (LFPs). In this work, we present a new state-space model framework that is able to detect concurrent changes in the rhythmic structure of LFPs with nonlocal activity in place cells to identify ripple-replay events in a causal manner. The model combines latent factors related to neural oscillations, represented space, and switches between coding properties to explain simultaneously the spiking activity from multiple units and the rhythmic content of LFPs recorded from multiple sources. The model is temporally causal, meaning that estimates of the switching state can be made at each instant using only past information from the spike and LFP signals, or can be combined with future data to refine those estimates. We applied this model framework to simulated and real hippocampal data to demonstrate its performance in identifying ripple-replay events.",2025-02-11,2025-02-08,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.05394"

However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation models on ASD recognition, and many existing models lack inherent interpretability, as they do not explicitly incorporate prior neurobiological knowledge such as the hierarchical structure of functional brain networks. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract latent representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy (HMMD), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to mitigate discrepancies in conditional distributions across domains. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior classification performance for ASD compared to baseline models, with improved robustness to multi-site heterogeneity. Specifically, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.03%. Moreover, its generalization capability is further validated through experiments conducted on extra Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) datasets.

In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory -- an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences' nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus -- a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains -- and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities -- spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing.",2025-02-08,2025-02-08,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.05680"

Feedback-evolving games have been a prevalent framework for studying such feedback in well-mixed populations, yielding important insights into the coevolutionary dynamics. However, since real populations are usually structured, it is essential to explore how population structure affects such coevolutionary dynamics. Our work proposes a coevolution model of strategies and environmental state in a structured population depicted by a regular graph. We investigate the system dynamics, and theoretically demonstrate that there exist different evolutionary outcomes including oscillation, bistability, the coexistence of oscillation and dominance, as well as the coexistence of cooperation and defection. Our theoretical predictions are validated through numerical calculations. By using Monte Carlo simulations we examine how the number of neighbors influences the coevolutionary dynamics, particularly the size of the attractive domain of the replete environmental state in the cases of bistability or cooperation-defection coexistence. Specifically, in the case of bistability, a larger neighborhood size may be beneficial to save the environment when the environmental enhancement rate by cooperation / degradation rate by defection is high. Conversely, if this ratio is low, a smaller neighborhood size is more beneficial. In the case of cooperator-defector coexistence, environmental maintenance is basically influenced by individual payoffs. When the ratio of temptation minus reward versus punishment minus sucker's payoff is high, a larger neighborhood size is more favorable. In contrast, when the mentioned ratio is low, a smaller neighborhood size is more advantageous.",2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.05764"

In this context, we are often confronted with the problem that data is sparse and uncertain. To use the available data as best as possible, inference approaches that can handle this uncertainty are required. One way that allows us to use not only cross-sectional data, but also phylogenetic related and longitudinal data, is using `hypercubic inference' models. In this article we introduce HyperLAU, a new algorithm for hypercubic inference that makes it possible to use datasets including uncertainties for learning evolutionary pathways. Expanding the flexibility of accumulation modelling, HyperLAU allows us to infer dynamic pathways and interactions between features, even when large sets of particular features are unobserved across the source dataset. We show that HyperLAU is able to highlight the main pathways found by other tools, even when up to 50% of the features in the input data are uncertain. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can help to overcome possible biases that can occur then reducing the used data by excluding uncertain parts. We illustrate the approach with a case study on multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, showing that HyperLAU allows more flexible data and provides new information about evolutionary pathways compared to existing approaches.",2025-06-23,2025-02-09,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2502.05872"

Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for $\mathcal{R}_0 < 1$. For the situation of $\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$, the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh--Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at $\mathcal{R}_0 = 1$, indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) mediate an immune response. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T-cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC class I alleles, and to design novel immunogenic peptides for specified TCR-MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based, physics-guided machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, the implicit physical reasoning in HERMES enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR-pMHC binding affinities and T-cell activities across diverse viral epitopes and cancer neoantigens, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR-MHC systems targeting viral and cancer peptides, we demonstrate that our designs -- with up to five substitutions from the native sequence -- activate T-cells at success rates of up to 50%. Lastly, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR-MHC complexes, offering key insights into T-cell specificity in both humans and mice.

Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).",2025-12-03,2025-03-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.00655"

In particular, the total QSSA (tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived as universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies have challenged this perception.

Ayati, Ryan Kinser","Chemical reaction network theory provides powerful tools for rigorously understanding chemical reactions and the dynamical systems and differential equations that represent them. A frequent issue with mathematical analyses of these networks is the reliance on explicit parameter values which in many cases cannot be determined experimentally. This can make analyzing a dynamical system infeasible, particularly when the size of the system is large. One approach is to analyze subnetworks of the full network and use the results for a full analysis.Our focus is on the equilibria of reaction networks. Gröbner basis computation is a useful approach for solving the polynomial equations which correspond to equilibria of a dynamical system. We identify a class of networks for which Gröbner basis computations of subnetworks can be used to reconstruct the more expensive Gröbner basis computation of the whole network.

Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy.

These limitations arise from their inherent focus on molecular interactions, often neglecting critical aspects of drug-likeness. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) framework, which combines the structural precision of 3D-SBDD models with the chemical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). CIDD begins by generating supporting molecules with 3D-SBDD models and then refines these molecules through LLM-supported modules to enhance drug-likeness and structural reasonability.

Despite extensive animal studies on its anatomy and function and growing evidence of claustral deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, its specific roles in normal and abnormal human brain function remain largely unknown. This is primarily due to its thin and complex morphology, which limits accurate anatomical delineation and neural activity isolation in conventional in vivo neuroimaging. To facilitate future neuroimaging studies, we developed a comprehensive and reliable manual segmentation protocol based on a cellular-resolution brain atlas and high-resolution (0.7^3 mm) MRI data. The protocols involve detailed guidelines to delineate the entire claustrum, including the inferior parts that have not been clearly described in earlier MRI studies. Additionally, we propose a geometric method to parcellate the claustrum into three subregions (the dorsal, ventral, and temporal claustrum) along the superior-to-inferior axis. The mean bilateral claustrum volume in 10 young adults was 3307.5 mm^3, approximately 0.21% of total intracranial volume.

Goykadosh, Harikrishnan Parameswaran","Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We show that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Further, we show that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be blocked by G{\alpha}q/11/14 inhibitor FR9003591, which inhibits the formation of myofibroblasts.

Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns.

This study develops a replicable national approach to identifying and characterising forest ecosystems, with a focus on the role of secondary forests. We hypothesised that dominant tree species in the forest canopy serve as reliable indicators for delineating forest ecosystems and untangling biodiversity complexity. Using national inventories, we identified in situ clusters through hierarchical clustering based on dominant species abundance dissimilarity, determined using the Importance Variable Index. These clusters were characterised by analysing species assemblages and their interactions. We then applied object-oriented Random Forest modelling, segmenting the national forest cover using NDVI to identify the forest ecosystems derived from in situ clusters. Freely available spectral (Sentinel-2) and environmental data were used in the model to delineate and characterise key forest ecosystems.

Petrovici","In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions builds on the assumption of symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment tend to circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they are known to scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, we show how SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks as compared to Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, we show how our proposed mechanism effectively enables the alignment of feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors.",2025-03-04,2025-03-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.02642"

Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity.

We show that the analytical form of this relationship can be derived from a simple Gaussian noise model, which in turn provides an intuitive interpretation for the scaling law. Finally, we show that the same relationship emerges in image classification models with respect to two types of imaging noise, suggesting that measurement noise scaling may be a general phenomenon.

However, a full understanding of their dynamical and thermodynamical properties, also in light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, remains a formidable endeavor. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling the interactions within these complex systems -- such as bacteria in microbial communities, plant-pollinator networks in forests, or starling murmurations -- presents a significant challenge. Given the characteristic high dimensionality of the datasets, alternative elegant approaches employ random matrix formalism and techniques from disordered systems. In these lectures, we will explore two cornerstone models in theoretical ecology: the MacArthur/Resource-Consumer model, and the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with a special focus on systems composed of a large number of interacting species. In the second part, we will highlight timely directions, particularly to bridge the gap with empirical observations and detect macroecological patterns.",2025-03-04,2025-03-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.02792"
"arXiv:2503.02794","Social hierarchy shapes foraging decisions","Lisa Blum Moyse, Ahmed El Hady","Social foraging is a widespread form of animal foraging in which groups of individuals coordinate their decisions to exploit resources in the environment. Animals show a variety of social structures from egalitarian to hierarchical. In this study, we examine how different forms of social hierarchy shape foraging decisions. We developed a mechanistic analytically tractable model to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic individual to the macroscopic group levels. Based on a stochastic evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large hierarchical group with leading and following individuals. Across a variety of information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically quantify emergent collective dynamics. We found that follower-leader dynamics through observations of leader movements or through counting the number of individuals in a patch confers, for most conditions, a benefit for the following individuals by increasing their accuracy in inferring patch richness. On the other hand, misinformation, through the communication of false beliefs about food rewards or patch quality, shows to be detrimental to following individuals, but paradoxically may lead to increased group cohesion. In an era where there is a huge amount of animal foraging data collected, our model provides a systematic way to conceptualize and understand those data by uncovering hidden mechanisms underlying social foraging decisions.",2025-03-04,2025-03-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.02794"

We focus on the relationships between iodine (I-), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) through the mixer, thyroid, sensor (pituitary gland), and metabolism. Iodine plays a fundamental role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as it is essential for the synthesis of T3 and T4, which regulate weight, energy, and other physiological functions. Iodine deficiency, which is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the world, can lead to hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by fatigue, weight gain, and cognitive impairments [1].Our model tracks the movement of iodine through dietary intake, thyroid absorption, hormone synthesis, feedback regulation via TSH, and deiodization in metabolism. By evaluating different forms of the accounting equation governing these processes, we have concluded three key results. 1) Iodide availability directly impacts levels of T3 and T4 production, with both component flow rates declining at day 70 in a mildly diseased state, and day 60 in a severely diseased state. 2) TSH is an early diagnostic indicator of thyroid issues, with TSH levels rising to magnitudes of 25x in just ten days, nearly six times quicker than other biological indicators. 3) There is a 5 day difference in iodine storage depletion between mild and severe iodide deficiency. Understanding these results quantitatively provides insights into thyroid disorders and informs strategies for managing iodine deficiency on both individual and public health levels.",2025-03-04,2025-03-04,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.02981"

Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of genomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms of unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred to as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a deep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly identifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary differences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable scalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose RawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore signals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first hash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we extend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1) provides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it more effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth, we explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal analysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all overlapping of raw signals using hash-based search.

Osborne","There is growing recognition in both the experimental and modelling literature of the importance of spatial structure to the dynamics of viral infections in tissues. Aided by the evolution of computing power and motivated by recent biological insights, there has been an explosion of new, spatially-explicit models for within-host viral dynamics in recent years. This development has only been accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially-structured models offer improved biological realism and can account for dynamics which cannot be well-described by conventional, mean-field approaches. However, despite their growing popularity, spatially-structured models of viral dynamics are underused in biological applications. One major obstacle to the wider application of such models is the huge variety in approaches taken, with little consensus as to which features should be included and how they should be implemented for a given biological context. Previous reviews of the field have focused on specific modelling frameworks or on models for particular viral species. Here, we instead apply a scoping review approach to the literature of spatially-structured viral dynamics models as a whole to provide an exhaustive update of the state of the field. Our analysis is structured along two axes, methodology and viral species, in order to examine the breadth of techniques used and the requirements of different biological applications. We then discuss the contributions of mathematical and computational modelling to our understanding of key spatially-structured aspects of viral dynamics, and suggest key themes for future model development to improve robustness and biological utility.",2025-07-04,2025-03-05,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.03131"

Brandon Ogbunugafor, Sudam Surasinghe","Asymptomatic infection has gained notoriety as an important feature of infectious disease dynamics. Despite increasing attention, there have been few rigorous examinations of how asymptomatic transmission influences pathogen evolution. In this study, we apply evolutionary invasion analysis to compute optimal strategies for viruses evolving in a system with a distinct asymptomatic transmission stage. We ask how pathogens would evolve under three conditions: with an increase in the mean infectious period in the symptomatic state, with an increase in the mean infectious period in the asymptomatic stage, and an increase in proportion proceeding through the ``mild recovery route"" (where the symptomatic state was bypassed entirely). We find that an increased proportion of cases moving through a ``mild recovery route"" -- which can occur with different host susceptibility or increased public health intervention -- leads to a model structure in which mutant pathogens are transmitted largely through the asymptomatic route, with slightly increased evolved virulence levels. In addition, we find that an increase in the mean infectious period of the symptomatic state has a small overall influence on the fitness of the pathogen, when effective transmission can occur via the asymptomatic route. Further, we find that virulence levels change very slightly for both the asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. In sum, our results highlight the evolutionary implications of variation in host susceptibility and public health interventions in the context of asymptomatic transmission. More generally, the findings speak to the need for more nuanced interrogations of subtle routes of transmission, as they can have profound implications in disease evolution, ecology, and epidemiology.",2025-03-05,2025-03-05,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2503.03310"

Traditional methods rely heavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown limited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their practical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a collaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide multi-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents, including a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent. The data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to learn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives, while the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching task-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates identifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six multi-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50% success rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical impact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the selectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds both A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the bioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known bioavailability limitations.

Low-dose PET (LDPET) provides a safer alternative by reducing radiation exposure. However, the inherent noise and blurred boundaries make organ segmentation more challenging.

Hypoglycemia, characterized by blood glucose levels below 70 mg/dL, is a life-threatening condition typically caused by excessive insulin administration, missed meals, or physical activity. Its asymptomatic nature impedes timely intervention, making ML models crucial for early detection.

"arXiv:2504.00028","Chaos and noise in evolutionary game dynamics","Maria Alejandra Ramirez, George Datseris, Arne Traulsen","Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to describe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent nonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations follow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our understanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos and noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite populations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.",2025-03-28,2025-03-28,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.00028"

However, extracting meaningful insights from biomedical data is often constrained by the lack of their available disease labels. In this research, we demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to enhance explainability and uncover biologically meaningful associations, even when predictive improvements in disease modeling are limited. We train LightGBM models from scratch on our dataset (10K) to impute metabolomics features and apply them to the UK Biobank (UKBB) for downstream analysis. The imputed metabolomics features are then used in survival analysis to assess their impact on disease-related risk factors. As a result, our approach successfully identified biologically relevant connections that were not previously known to the predictive models. Additionally, we applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on key metabolomics features, revealing a link between vascular dementia and smoking. Although being a well-established epidemiological relationship, this link was not embedded in the model's training data, which validated the method's ability to extract meaningful signals. Furthermore, by integrating survival models as inputs in the 10K data, we uncovered associations between metabolic substances and obesity, demonstrating the ability to infer disease risk for future patients without requiring direct outcome labels. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging external bio-banks to extract valuable biomedical insights, even in data-limited scenarios.

Results: Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015, and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as diabetes (1.9%, 2.1%, and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1%, and 0.4%). For these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6-85.1% in 2003, 1.3-85.2% in 2015, and 3.0-89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in 2015, and 0.78 in 2022. Discussion: The under-coding could be primarily due to the increase of hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to coders. There is a potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based on electronic health records to support coding practices and improve coding quality. Conclusion: Comorbidities were increasingly under-coded over 20 years. The validity of ICD-10 decreased but remained relatively stable for certain conditions mandated for coding. The under-coding exerted minimal impact on in-hospital mortality prediction.",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.00052"

In the present setting each individual has a type x belonging to a general space, and a vaccination strategy is a function $\eta$ where $\eta$(x) $\in$ [0, 1] represents the proportion of non-vaccinated among individuals of type x. We shall consider two loss functions associated to a vaccination strategy $\eta$: either the effective reproduction number, a classical quantity appearing in many models in epidemiology, and which is given here by the spectral radius of a compact operator that depends on $\eta$; or the overall proportion of infected individuals after vaccination in the maximal endemic this http URL considering the weak-* topology on the set $\Delta$ of vaccination strategies, so that it is a compact set, we can prove that those two loss functions are continuous using the notion of collective compactness for a family of operators.

Bassler","Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. This change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.",2025-09-03,2025-04-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.00300"

However, its pharmacokinetics are underexplored. This study investigates JHT's pharmacokinetics in normal rats and its differences in normal, CSG, and intestinal microbial disorder rats. A quantitative method for seven active ingredients in rat plasma was established using UPLC-TQ-MS/MS. After administering various JHT doses, plasma concentrations were measured to assess pharmacokinetics in normal rats. The pharmacokinetics of four main ingredients were compared in normal, CSG, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats. Intestinal microbial changes were evaluated by high-throughput sequencing. Spearman correlation analysis linked ingredient exposure to gut microbiota disturbances. The method showed good linearity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, and stability. In normal rats, all seven ingredients were rapidly absorbed. Tetrahydropalmatine, corydaline, costunolide, and rhamnosylvitexin had good exposure, while dehydrocorydaline, allocryptopine, and palmatine hydrochloride had low exposure. Tetrahydropalmatine, corydaline, and costunolide followed linear pharmacokinetics (AUC0-t, Cmax) at doses of 0.7-5.6 g/kg, while rhamnosylvitexin and dehydrocorydaline showed linearity at 0.7-2.8 g/kg. In CSG and FMT rats, pharmacokinetic differences were observed. CSG enhanced costunolide exposure and Cmax, and increased rhamnosylvitexin exposure.

Chalub, Matheus Hansen","The pursuit of strategies that minimize the number of individuals needing vaccination to control an outbreak is a well-established area of study in mathematical epidemiology. However, for certain diseases, public policy tends to prioritize immunizing vulnerable individuals over epidemic control. As a result, optimal vaccination strategies may not always be effective in supporting real-world public policies. A similar situation happens when a new vaccine is introduced and is in short supply, as target priority groups for vaccination have to be defined. In this work, we focus on a disease that results in long-term immunity and spreads through a heterogeneous population, represented by a contact network. We study four well-known group centrality measures and show that the GED-Walk offers a reliable means of estimating the impact of vaccinating specific groups of individuals, even in suboptimal cases. Additionally, we depart from the search for target individuals to be vaccinated and provide proxies for identifying optimal groups for vaccination. While the GED-Walk is the most useful centrality measure for suboptimal cases, the betweenness (a related, but different centrality measure) stands out when looking for optimal groups. This indicates that optimal vaccination is not concerned with breaking the largest number of transmission routes, but interrupting geodesic ones.",2025-06-23,2025-04-01,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.00572"

We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach.

Cathepsins, a family of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, have been implicated in the progression of various tumors. However, the causal relationship between the cathepsin family and EAC remains unresolved. Methods: To evaluate these potential causal associations, integrative analyses were conducted, integrating Mendelian randomization (MR), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) analyses. Results: Univariable and multivariable MR analyses demonstrated that elevated levels of cathepsin B (CTSB) were associated with a reduced risk of EAC. The TWAS analysis identified a negative association between CTSB expression in esophageal tissue and EAC, consistent with experimental validation using immunohistochemistry. The scRNA-seq data analysis indicated that CTSB expression was predominantly localized in macrophages infiltrating EAC. Colocalization analysis incorporating sc-eQTL data specific to macrophages confirmed a shared causal variant between CTSB and macrophages. Additionally, MR analysis of CTSB and macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) types I and II established their interrelationship, suggesting that CTSB may influence the proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages, ultimately affecting EAC risk. Conclusions: This integrative analysis, utilizing MR, TWAS, scRNA-seq, and sc-eQTL data, identified a significant causal association between CTSB and EAC, potentially mediated through macrophage MSR regulation. These findings suggest that targeting cathepsin B could represent a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of EAC.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.01270"

To address these issues, we propose BOLDSimNet, a novel framework utilizing Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) to measure causal connectivity and network similarity across different cognitive states. Our method groups functionally similar regions of interest (ROIs) rather than spatially adjacent nodes, improving accuracy in network alignment. We applied BOLDSimNet to fMRI data from 40 healthy controls and found that children exhibited higher similarity scores between task and resting states compared to adolescents, indicating reduced variability in attention shifts. In contrast, adolescents showed more differences between task and resting states in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN), reflecting enhanced network adaptability.

However, for some individuals, these responses can be distressing enough to interfere with daily functioning. Despite their prevalence, the mechanisms underlying auditory-induced emotion remain only partially understood. Prior research has identified contributing factors such as auditory features, listener traits, and bodily sensations. However, most studies have focused on acoustic features, leaving the role of syntactic structure largely unexplored. This study specifically investigates how hierarchical syntactic structures influence emotional experience, in conjunction with listener traits and bodily sensations. An online experiment was conducted with 715 participants, who listened to 26 sound sequences varying systematically in hierarchical syntactic complexity. Sequences were generated by combining three types of local pitch movement with three types of global pitch movement in ascending and descending pitch directions, resulting in nine complexity levels. Participants rated the valence and arousal of each sequence and indicated any bodily sensations on a body map. Measures of sensory processing patterns were also collected. Results showed that emotional valence was associated with the complex interplay of moderate syntactic complexity (""not too simple, not too complex""), sensory sensitivity, and upper torso sensations. These findings expand existing research by identifying syntactic features that shape auditory-induced emotional experience and highlight the link between bodily sensation and emotional response. They also suggest potential applications for incorporating syntactic design into therapeutic approaches to emotion regulation.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.01287"

Previous studies reported that the presence of tinnitus is notably absent during dreams. This study aimed at replicating previous findings regarding tinnitus-free dreams, while also gaining a deeper understanding of tinnitus manifestations during dreams and after awakening. (2) Methods: For this observational study, 195 tinnitus patients answered an online survey on the mutual-help community Siopi. (3) Results: 160 patients could recall their dreams. Among them, 92.5% state they do not hear their tinnitus while dreaming. The rest (7.5%) report higher tinnitus burden, higher stress and more often exhibit objective tinnitus and/or tinnitus related to peripheral auditory pathology and/or drug intake. 13% of the participants frequently experience lucid dreams. Among them, 36% could perceive their tinnitus during lucid dreams, and this was strongly associated with the concomitant perception of external sounds during lucid dreaming. While the majority of patients report perceiving their tinnitus instantly upon awakening, during nocturnal awakenings, 18% declared they could be awakened by their tinnitus and 9.8% mentioned that their tinnitus can temporarily cease.

Within these pipelines, reliable quality assessment must be ensured to validate the generated results. Image quality assessment is often applied with full-reference methods to estimate the similarity between the ground truth and the output images. However, current methods often show poor agreement with visual perception and lead to the generation of various full-reference metrics tailored to specific applications. Additionally, they rely on pixel-wise comparisons, emphasizing local intensity similarity while often overlooking comprehensive and interpretable image quality assessment. To address these issues, we have developed a multi-marker similarity method that compares standard quality markers, such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast, and high frequency components. The method computes a similarity score between the image and the ground truth for each marker, then combines these scores into an overall similarity estimate. This provides a full-reference estimate of image quality while extracting global quality features and detecting experimental artifacts. Multi-marker similarity provides a reliable and interpretable method for image quality assessment and the generation of quality rankings. By focusing on the comparison of quality markers rather than direct image distances, the method enables reduced reference implementations, where a single field of view is used as a benchmark for multiple measurements. This opens the way for reliable automatic evaluation of big datasets, typical of large biomedical studies, when manual assessment of single images and defining the ground truth for each field of view is not feasible.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.01537"

Exercise presents additional challenges due to complex effects on glucose dynamics. Despite advancements in diabetes technology, significant gaps remain in understanding the relationship between exercise, glycemic variability (GV), and hypoglycemia in both automated insulin delivery (AID) and non-AID users. Additionally, limited research explores the temporal progression of GV before and after hypoglycemia and the impact of long-duration episodes on glucose recovery. This study analyses the Type 1 Diabetes and Exercise Initiative (T1DEXI) dataset, assessing GV, hypoglycemia, gender, and exercise interactions in AID (n=222) and non-AID (n=276) users. The study examined patterns of glycemic variability metrics like time below range (TBR) surrounding hypoglycemia events, focusing on the 48 hours before and after these events. We further assess the impact of different hypoglycemia levels (41-50 mg/dL, 51-60 mg/dL, and 61-70 mg/dL) on post-event glucose stability. GV increased before and after hypoglycemia up to 48 hours in both AID and non-AID users, with statistically significant differences. TBR elevation persisted across all groups, peaking around hypoglycemic episodes. Notably, females using AID achieved significantly improved glucose stability compared to non-AID females - a larger within-group difference than that observed in males. Individual-level AID analyses showed that long hypoglycemia episodes (>40 minutes) led to prolonged TBR elevation, suggesting slower recovery despite AID intervention. GV trends may aid in predicting hypoglycemia over extended periods. Integrating GV patterns into AID systems could enhance glucose stability and mitigate hypoglycemia cycles.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.01624"

Taylor, Yujiang Wang","Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but their precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether ASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a shorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity patterns.Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from 28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure occurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns (states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these to different ASM levels.Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering unmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these 'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without taper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224% longer durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\beta$ = -0.049, p < 0.001).Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress specific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and (ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight the complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized dosing strategies for epilepsy management.

However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss.

Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02014"

When they are, only select tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and cellular environments are typically considered, despite appreciation that adaptive variants often exhibit context-dependent effects. In this review, we 1) discuss why context-dependent regulatory loci might be especially evolutionarily relevant in primates, 2) explore challenges and emerging solutions for mapping such context-dependent variation, and 3) discuss the scientific questions these data could address. We argue that filling this gap will provide critical insights into evolutionary processes, human disease, and regulatory adaptation.",2025-04-02,2025-04-02,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02081"

However, they remain less studied than their more urban cousins, \textit{Aedes aegypti}. We model an Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) strategy for mosquito control, with bi-directional incompatibility between two strains of \textit{Wolbachia} (\walba/\walbb\, $\times$ \arwp) and age-based cytoplasmic incompatibility decay in a well-mixed population. An important consideration in bi-directional IIT control programs is reversibility when immigration is included. We explore the establishment probability after female contamination of an artificially-infected \textit{Wolbachia} mosquito strain, finding a conservative threshold of 40\% likely driven by mating inefficiencies -- this threshold needs validation in future field and lab experiments. We consider the suppression dynamics and probability of mosquito management success for different release strategies, showing differences in success between release cessation and six months later for different immigration rates. Importantly, our model suggests bi-directional IIT control programs are reversible with low amounts of immigration. We determine a corresponding cost proxy (numbers of mosquitoes released), showing similar short-term costs with differences in medium- and longer-term costs between release strategies. This work demonstrates opportunities to optimise the suppression of these medically important mosquitoes.",2025-04-03,2025-04-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02203"
"arXiv:2504.02332","Stability of complex communities: A perspective from discrete-time dynamics","Shuaiying Wang, Yuguang Yang, Aming Li","Understanding the stability of complex communities is a central focus in ecology, many important theoretical advancements have been made to identify drivers of ecological stability. However, previous results often rely on the continuous-time dynamics, assuming that species have overlapping generations. In contrast, numerous real-world communities consist of species with non-overlapping generations, whose quantitative behavior can only be precisely represented by discrete-time dynamics rather than continuous ones. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability of complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse interaction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping generations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes and then destabilizes complex communities. This pattern is further confirmed in both exploitative (E. aerogenes, P. aurantiaca, P. chlororaphis, P. citronellolis) and competitive (P. putida, P. veroni, S. marcescens) soil microbial communities. Moreover, we show that communities with diverse interaction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical mouse microbial networks. Furthermore, we reveal that the prevalence of weak interactions can stabilize communities, which is consistent with findings from existing microbial experiments. Our analyses of complex communities with non-overlapping generations provide a more comprehensive understanding of ecological stability and informs practical strategies for ecological restoration and control.",2025-04-03,2025-04-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02332"
"arXiv:2504.02399","Bayesian eco-evolutionary game dynamics","Arunava Patra, Joy Das Bairagya, Sagar Chakraborty","The symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of classical game theory and evolutionary game theory is well-established. However, evolutionary game theorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information where players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of the resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We investigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy channel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy information can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct.",2025-04-03,2025-04-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02399"

This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to behaviours around testing and isolation. This epidemiological-behavioural interaction is of particular interest as, prospectively, it is well-placed to be informed by real-world data temporally monitoring test results and compliance with testing policy. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing ""behaviour and disease"" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented interdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions (including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural effects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage further modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease dynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.",2025-04-03,2025-04-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02488"

Many existing models do not fully capture the complex, multiscale interactions among neuronal activity, astrocytic signaling, and vascular dynamics--especially in key brainstem regions. In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational framework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which represents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular dynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a one-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic component. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter signaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of functional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain cerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter release triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize oxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the first model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a robust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology of cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including the regulation of stomach function.",2025-04-05,2025-04-03,"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv:2504.02540"

The model addresses dispersal processes by incorporating the ecological traits, including habitat preferences of the species, potential growth rate, home range, and carrying capacity. In this model, the landscape is divided into spatial units based on the home range, and the probability of individuals moving from one spatial unit to another is calculated using habitat preference and population density. The movement probability between different spatial locations is determined by the product of two factors: the escape probability based on the relative ratio of population density to carrying capacity and the relative difference in habitat preferences. Both probabilities are calculated using logistic functions. The results indicate that the combination of habitat preference and local density dependence plays a role in shaping the dispersal patterns of G. glis.

Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information.

The fungus causes Asian rust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South American soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the cultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in Brazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop seasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be spread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the objective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the atmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west, Paraguay/Bolivia to Paraná Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts. The transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive equation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paraná state between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real cases of rust occurrence in the Paraná state informed by the Anti-rust Consortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm mathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on the west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of Paraná. The first case of soybean rust in Paraná state/Brazil was registered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported and deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection.
